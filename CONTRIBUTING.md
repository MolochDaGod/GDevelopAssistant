## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` and `let`, not `var`
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Follow existing code style
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

### Example:

```javascript
/**
 * Process AI query and return response
 * @param {string} agentId - The agent identifier
 * @param {string} query - The query text
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} The AI response
 */
async function processAIQuery(agentId, query) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors appropriately
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Return meaningful error messages
- Log errors with appropriate context

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/ai-agents.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for good code coverage
- Use descriptive test names

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update API.md for API changes
- Add JSDoc comments to your code
- Update DEPLOYMENT.md for deployment changes

## Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

```
Add: New feature description
Fix: Bug fix description
Update: Update description
Refactor: Refactoring description
Docs: Documentation changes
```

Examples:
- `Add: WebSocket support for game rooms`
- `Fix: Database connection timeout issue`
- `Update: Increase AI agent timeout to 30s`
- `Docs: Add API examples for cloud storage`

3. Code must follow style guidelines
4. Documentation must be updated
5. No merge conflicts
